    "Justin worked on the exploration and description of the dataset. Justin first started by creating tables that had the data descriptions from Kaggle. Justin then created each of the data frames by reading in the CSVs. Then using the data frames created, he viewed their shape, then viewing each of  the top 5 rows of the data frames. He then used a function to view all of the common columns that appeared multiple times across the data frames. He then examined the categorical vs numeric data that was found within each data frame by looking at the summary stats of the numeric data and then looking at the proportions and unique values of the categorical data to see a vector of all possible classifications for categorical variables. \n"
